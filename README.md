# ❗This repository is now DEPRECATED

[We now use PagerDuty’s postmortem](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/projects/managed-hubs/incidents/#create-an-incident-report) feature to create the Incident Report. This lets us use notes, status updates from pagerduty as well as messages from Slack easily in the incident report!

## 2i2c Incident reports

The 2i2c infrastructure is constantly evolving. As people use our hubs,
different issues often arise that result in new needs for development and
updates to the deployment. 2i2c follows a process of transparent and blameless
post-mortems to address these issues now, and prevent them from happening in the
future. This repository contains those reports.
